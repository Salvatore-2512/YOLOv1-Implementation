# YOLOv1 Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, inspired by the original paper:  
📄 **"You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection"** (CVPR 2016) by Joseph Redmon et al.

## ▶️ Running the Code

1. **Clone this repository**:
   bash
  git clone https://github.com/Salvatore-2512/YOLOv1-Implementation.git
  cd YOLOv1-Implementation

2. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook "YOLOv1 Implementation.ipynb"
   
3. Run each cell to execute the implementation.

## YOLOv1 Summary
- Treats object detection as a regression problem.
- Single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.
- Fast and efficient: real-time object detection on images and video.

## Architecture
- The original YOLOv1 architecture uses 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.
